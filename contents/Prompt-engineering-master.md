## Zero-shot prompting
Zero-shot prompting enables a machine learning model to tackle new tasks without extra training, by using detailed instructions provided in the input.

```
prompt = """Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. 
Text: I think the vacation is great.
Sentiment:"""
```
```
Response = "Sentiment: Positive"
```
